I’m a Pre-Doctoral research fellow at the [School of Business and Economics, Universidad de los Andes, Chile](https://www.uandes.cl/sbe/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, where I serve as a research assistant to Professor [Jorge Alé-Chilet](https://sites.google.com/site/jorgealechilet/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, focusing on empirical industrial organization topics. I hold a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Economics at the [University of Chile](https://econ.uchile.cl/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 

I'm interested in empirical and theoretical industrial organization and the intersection of mechanism design and market design.
